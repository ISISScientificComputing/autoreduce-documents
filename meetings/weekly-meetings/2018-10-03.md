General discussion points
=========================

* We need to encourage use of autoreduce@reduce.isis.cclrc.ac.uk. Maybe have a rota for checking it during cycle or otherwise. This is to avoid the case we had recently where Pascal emailed Elliot directly while he was on holiday. Perhaps better we should have all emails to this addressed forwarded to slack? We have relevative few emailed to this address: some nagios, a couple from Simon and a few reduce.py script error message. I suggest that we don't have reduce.py script errors emailed since they should be fixed by instrument scientists, but otherwise stuff send to this address
